### Question 1

Design an immutable class for representing two-dimensional sparse matrices. Note that for space efficiency you should be storing only non zero elements of a matrix.

a) It should support following methods 
return transpose of the matrix
check whether it is a symmetrical matrix
add two matrices
multiply two matrices

b) What is the time complexity of each of the methods?

Things to keep in mind
Object should be immutable
Write junit test cases
Methods should be efficient
