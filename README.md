# GETA2021 Algorithm analysis & design paradigm Session 1


### Question1 
Define the interface for a dictionary and implement it using a binary search tree. The interface should support 
constructor to create a dictionary with a specified initial dictionary entries*, 
add a key-value pair to dictionary, 
delete a key value pair from the dictionary, 
get the value corresponding to a specified key, 
return sorted list of key value pairs, 
return the sorted list of key value pairs for all the keys >=K1 and <=K2.

*The constructor will receive a list of key value pairs to be inserted in the dictionary. The list will be provided as a JSON value.

### Question2 
Consider a linked-list of Employees (NOT sorted) and sort the employees with the following strategy
Sort (descending) based on their salary, the one having the highest salary should be the 1st and the one having the lowest should be the last.
If there is a tie between salaries then the one with a lesser age should go before.
Note- 
You are NOT allowed to use any Java collection API
You can use insertion sort approach for sorting
